\section{Plan}
At a high level the idea (was/is at this point/might be) is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Somehow get our hands on a model of all (most) middleboxes in the
network. This might be computed using program analysis or be provided by
someone etc.
\item Hook up middleboxes as a network, verify that some high level policies (for instance isolation) holds given the model. 
\item If step 2 reveals that things are peachy, generate some packets to verify that the model itself is actually behaving reasonably.
\item Prosper.
\end{itemize}

For now we (I) are focusing on step 2. In particular the plan is to generate models for a variety of middleboxes and
see what we could do with this. Since I was having a hard time actually doing the model generation (I did not know what
part of the model was relevant, amount of detail required, etc.), I decided to generate only two models and try and
actually prove something in a simple network.

For what follows, most of the proofs and such were generated using \href{http://z3.codeplex.com/}{Z3} a SMT solver from
MSR.

\section{Middleboxes so Far}
This is a list of middle boxes modeled so far:
\begin{itemize}
\item Packet Filters (simple ACL firewalls)
\item Stateful firewalls
\item Web proxies
\item Learning switches.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results so Far}

}
\caption{Two topologies}
\label{fig:topologies}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}
Consider the two topologies in Figure~\ref{fig:topologies} and Firewall rules that disallow communication between
endhosts $A, C$ and $B, D$. Globally we want to ensure that $B$ cannot ever induce a packet to be sent to $D$ and $A$
cannot ever induce a packet to be sent to $C$. This policy is only enforceable in Figure~\ref{fig:fwwp} since the packet
looses information that is required for enforcement when it goes through the web proxy.

Currently we can generate counter examples for Figure~\ref{fig:wpfw} where the global policy does
not hold. Similarly for Figure~\ref{fig:fwwp} it can prove that the global policy does hold (by showing that no packets
satisfy the negation of the global constraints). 

We can also generate results with stateful firewalls for the same topologies, where depend on firewall rules even Figure
~\ref{fig:fwwp} can have a policy violation. Furthermore, we can even generate a counter example where the firewall is entirely 
correct but we model the response part of the web proxy. In reality the only way to ensure isolation in either of these
topologies is to either have firewalls on both sides of the proxy or model the end hosts as servers and clients, where servers
never generate any requests.

\section{Other Concerns}
First-order logic with quantifiers ($\forall$ and $\exists$) is
undecidable and will sometimes trip up the solver. Normally one tries to reexpress the constraints or add additional
(redundant) constraints for the solver to work, but I haven't yet figured out what combination of constraints will help.
This is generally a problem for this sort of thing, but on average proof that there is a bug can be gotten really
quickly, but proving that there is no bug can take quite long.

\section{What is New}
A few things are different now:
\begin{itemize}
\item We actually account for things like routing tables now, so hooking into something like HSA should be simpler.
\item Stateful middleboxes like learning firewalls (also learning switches, but at least for analyzing isolation they are
not super interesting).
\item A saner model (it is easier to analyze and figure out what is wrong).
\end{itemize}

\section{Next Steps}
Now that most of the modeling seems to work quite well there were a few different things I was considering doing next:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add support for time: currently we flatten out time in some sense, and this will become a problem as we start generating 
test since state changes depend on time. I think this should be simple.
\item Model end hosts more richly to state what they would generate requests for. I feel a bit fishy doing this but then again without making
    some assumptions about the behavior of everything we end up with models where isolation is always violated.
\item In cases where we do not satisfy policy I should probably generate packets (or some semantic equivalent) that the network can
actually be tested with. This is where things would get interesting/complex.
\item Even in case where we do satisfy policy, it might be good to generate packets and some expected behavior to test that the model
provided has some basis in reality. I imagine doing this exhaustively might be very hard.
\item Hooking onto HSA or some other existing reachability thing: I changed things so that this should be easy, but I don't know what HSA output
    looks like, so need some mechanical work for this.
\item Maybe look at properties other than isolation, for instance the original learning switch performance bug that started this all.
\item One realization that I Had while trying to fix bugs in this logic was that all of these policies are actually quite hard to implement in practice. The
problem being that some of these problems are a lot harder when decomposed than not: for instance a web proxy that also enforces ACLs (for instance Squid) is 
actually in a better position to improve isolation propoerties than a separate firewall and web proxy. I think the same is probably true for other of these kinds
of middleboxes, and there is a question here that I am not quite sure about.

%This is boring, I had to write this to reason about my code and it seemed like it might be useful someday.
